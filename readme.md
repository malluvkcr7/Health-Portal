# Health-Portal

# Project Title
On my website, users are initially prompted to identify themselves as either a patient or a doctor. Depending on their choice, they are redirected to create an account within their respective domains. For patients, the platform allows scheduling appointments by providing details about the health problem, selecting a preferred specialist, and choosing a date and time. The system intelligently manages conflicts in appointment scheduling.

Once the appointment is set, patients are prompted to input personal information, including height, weight, and allergies. On the doctor's side, there is a dedicated dashboard where doctors can view upcoming appointments and access personal information about their patients. Doctors can provide remarks and prescriptions, which are then visible to the patients once updated. This ensures a streamlined and secure communication channel between patients and doctors.
